This project was generated using a [Plaster template](https://github.com/lagebj/PlasterTemplates) that is shared with the community. It is modeled after the way I build my projects. A lot of the base structure for this project was put in place by that Plaster template. [lagebj.github.io](http://lagebj.github.io)
